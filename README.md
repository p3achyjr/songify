# songify

This is the code powering Sonnetify, a keyboard that attempts to learn the player's patterns and generate a harmony to play along. 

In this code, we translate a signal from our keyboard into a midi signal, which then gets interpreted and played by Garageband. We wanted to create a Markov chain for the learning aspect, but because we were short on time, we simply made a collection of chords and notes to choose from.
